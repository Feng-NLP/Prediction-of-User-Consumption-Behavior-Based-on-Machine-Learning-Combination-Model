# Prediction-of-User-Consumption-Behavior-Based-on-Machine-Learning-Combination-Model
2021 National College Students Data Statistics and Analysis Competition B -- User Consumption behavior prediction based on machine learning combination model

Title B: Value Analysis of User Consumption Behavior In today's world of Internet development, companies in all fields are expanding Internet access channels, introducing fresh and active users to their products, increasing their desire to buy products, and enhancing their brand influence. However, how to identify high-quality users and channels and optimize marketing costs has been a pain point for companies; This requires the analysis of user behavior data, the identification of user value, and then the development of special marketing strategies for users, to achieve low cost promotion, to achieve the goal of improving user conversion rate. Existing user information table (user_info.csv), user login information table (login_day.csv), user access statistics table (visit_info.csv), and user order table (result.csv). Make statistics and analysis of user behaviors with data. And determine whether the user will place an order.

Task 1: Obtain data and preprocess it to improve data quality;

Task 2: Analyze the distribution and login of users in different cities, and visually display the results in various forms respectively;

Task 3: Build a model to judge whether the user will finally place an order to purchase or the probability of placing an order to purchase, and output the model results into csv files (refer to the result output sample sample_output.csv). The model is required to achieve more than 85% of the effect;

Task 4: Put forward reasonable suggestions to the enterprise through the value analysis of user consumption behavior.
